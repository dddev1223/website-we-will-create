                <h2>About the Industry</h2>
                <p>
                    The automotive industry focuses on the design, production, and sale of motor vehicles. 
                    It creates vehicles for people around the world by combining 
                    engineering, and business management. In order to make important decisions 
                    regarding production, pricing, and sustainability, modern automotive companies rely  
                    on technology, and data analytics.
                </p>

                <h2>My Role: Financial Analyst</h2>
                <p>
                    As a Financial Analyst, I review and interpret financial data to help management make informed
                    business decisions. My responsibilities include analyzing production costs, forecasting future
                    expenses, managing budgets, and preparing reports that measure performance across departments.
                    I also work closely with engineering and marketing teams to ensure resources are allocated
                    effectively and profit goals are met.
                </p>

                <h2>Ethical Issue That Could Arise</h2>
                <p>
                    An ethical issue in my position could involve the manipulation of financial data to make results
                    look better than they are. Adjusting forecasts or hiding losses would
                    temporarily benefit the company’s image; however, it would mislead stakeholders and violate financial
                    integrity. Maintaining honesty and transparency in reporting this data is essential for building trust
                    and ensuring ethical business practices.
                </p>

                <h2>Two Cybersecurity Issues That Could Arise</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Data Breaches:</strong> Financial systems store sensitive data and if unauthorized users gain access to those files                        the company could face financial loss and reputational damage.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Ransomware Attacks:</strong> Cybercriminals could encrypt important financial
                        records or production data and demand payment to restore access, halting daily operations
                        and disrupting manufacturing and payroll systems.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Cybersecurity Best Practices</h2>
                <p>
                    To protect sensitive data and maintain business continuity, the automotive industry should:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Use strong passwords and 2FA to limit unauthorized access.</li>
                    <li>Regularly back up financial and production data to secure locations.</li>
                    <li>Keep all financial software and network systems updated with the latest security patches.</li>
                    <li>Provide cybersecurity training for employees to prevent phishing and social engineering attacks.</li>
                </ol>
