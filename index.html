            <h2>Trust</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Trust is something I learned from my family. Growing up, I was taught that honesty is the start of every strong relationship.</li>
                    <li>It matters in college because people are meeting me for the first time, and I want them to see me as dependable and real.</li>
                    <li>When I make a promise, such as finishing my part of a project or showing up prepared, I do my best to keep it.</li>
                    <li>If I do not stay trustworthy, I risk losing respect and damaging relationships, which makes success harder in school and in life.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Collaboration</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>I learned the value of collaboration from playing sports and doing group activities where teamwork always gave better results than working alone.</li>
                    <li>In college, listening to other perspectives helps me grow and see ideas I might not have thought of myself.</li>
                    <li>Collaboration is important because it makes learning more engaging and prepares me for future careers where teamwork is needed.</li>
                    <li>If I do not work well with others, I risk missing useful ideas and building a reputation for being difficult to work with.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Excellence</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Excellence comes from my desire to make my family proud and to prove to myself that I can reach higher goals.</li>
                    <li>It matters because it pushes me to put effort into my work instead of turning in something rushed or careless.</li>
                    <li>Excellence means aiming for steady improvement. I focus on growth rather than perfection.</li>
                    <li>If I do not strive for excellence, I may fall into poor habits that hold me back both in school and in life.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Accountability</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>I value accountability because I have seen how much it matters when one person fails to take responsibility. Others often suffer the results.</li>
                    <li>In college, accountability matters because professors, classmates, and friends are counting on me to meet deadlines and keep my word.</li>
                    <li>Taking responsibility for mistakes helps me build trust, earn respect, and learn from them.</li>
                    <li>If I ignore accountability, I risk losing credibility, letting people down, and weakening my own discipline.</li>
                </ol>
